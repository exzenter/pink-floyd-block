# Pink Floyd Prism Block

Calculate the dark side of your DOM. A WordPress block that simulates light refraction through a prism using the HTML5 Canvas API, featuring interactive physics and "Pink Floyd" style aesthetics.

## Features

- **Interactive Prism Physics**: Real-time simulation of light refraction (Snell's Law) and dispersion.
- **Interactive Controls**:
  - Control beam entry position and angle.
  - Adjust indices of refraction and dispersion.
  - Toggle between "Boxed" and "Fullwidth" modes.
- **DOM Rainbow Extension**: Rainbow rays can "escape" the canvas and extend across the entire webpage (DOM elements), scrolling with the content.
- **Stylized Aesthetics**: Custom "grain" rendering, glow effects, and faithful album art color palettes.

## Installation

1.  Clone this repository into your WordPress plugins directory.
2.  Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3.  Run `npm start` to compile the block for development.

## Development

-   `src/`: Source files for the block (React/JSX and logic).
    -   `prism-canvas.js`: Core physics engine and rendering logic.
    -   `edit.js`: Editor interface and controls.
    -   `view.js`: Frontend initialization.
-   `build/`: Compiled assets (generated by `@wordpress/scripts`).

## Usage

Insert the "Pink Floyd Prism" block in the Gutenberg editor. Use the inspector controls to adjust the physics simulation parameters.
